  summary: Built-package format for Python
  description: |
    A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename and
    the .whl extension. It is designed to contain all the files for a PEP
    376 compatible install in a way that is very close to the on-disk format.
    Many packages will be properly installed with only the "Unpack" step
    (simply extracting the file onto sys.path), and the unpacked archive
    preserves enough information to "Spread" (copy data and scripts to their
    final locations) at any later time.
